# Assignment 5: Trivia Game with Vue.js
## Assignment
The assignment was to build a Single Page Application trivia game with Vue.js 3. We had to make use of the [Trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) for the questions.
To keep track of users and highscore we had to use an other [API](https://github.com/dewald-els/noroff-assignment-api) which Noroff made for easy use in our assignments.

We had to make at least 3 different pages: a start, questions and results page.
## How To Use
Go to the following website: https://savannah-borst.github.io/Assignment_Computer_Store/

Make up a username and select the properties you want your trivia to have and click start.

## Future
Future work may include:
- A welcome (back) page once the user has clicked confirm on the start page.
- Changing some of the local storage to more VueX implementations
